# Python_Game
A fun project for those who want to code some game in python :)

## Goal
As the name of the project says: this project claims to create games in python.
Everyone is welcomed, your coding level doesn't matter as the project was first thought to be an initiation to python.
Of course the games we will code will be more complexe as the project goes on, but no worries if you're a bit lost, we will help you ! We don't like to see people struggle ;)

## Other info:
This project will in collaboration with the Discord Bot project. Most of the game we will code will be implemented to the discord bot in some way.
If you have an idea of a game we could code that isn't on the list yet, go on discord and suggest your idea !
Don't be afraid we don't bite, we are all mind-open :)
